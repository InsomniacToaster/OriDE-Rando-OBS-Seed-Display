# Installation
Download the file from releases.
In OBS Studio, go to Tools -> Scripts -> + and find the file you downloaded.

# Usage
In the script properties:
	Set the text source you want to be populated.
	Set the path to your randomizer.dat file.
In OBS properties:
	Go to Hotkeys and add a hotkey for "Load Seed Name" (recommended: Alt+L).

Now anytime you press the registered hotkey, your text source will populate with the seed name and
first two seed parameters (difficulty and mode).
