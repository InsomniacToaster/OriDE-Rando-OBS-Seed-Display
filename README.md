# Installation
Download the latest `ori_rando_seed_name.lua` file from [releases](https://github.com/jhobz/ori-obs-scripts/releases)

In OBS Studio, go to Tools -> Scripts -> + and find the file you downloaded.

# Usage
In the script properties:

* Set the text source you want to be populated.
* Set the path to your randomizer.dat file.
* *(Optional)* Customize the output format.

In OBS properties:

* Go to Hotkeys and add a hotkey for "Load Seed Name" (recommended: Alt+L).

Now anytime you press the registered hotkey, your text source will populate with the seed name and
first two seed parameters (difficulty and mode).
